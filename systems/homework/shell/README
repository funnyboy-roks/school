Name: Hayden Pott
The program works by repeatedly prompting for user input and then
splitting that on spaces, determining what the first argument is and
whether it needs to find that on the path.  If it does, then it searches
every path element for the binary with the name given and if it finds
it, then it will execute it.  It then passes each arg to be executed
using the reset of the args passed.  If one of the args is '>',
then the next arg is interpreted to be the output file, the same thing
happens with '<' except for input.

If there is a src(in) or dst(out) file, when the program forks, it
replaces its STDIN with the src and/or STDOUT with dst before calling
the binary.
